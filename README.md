# News Study

This is a research project studying the perceptions of fake news. The primary research question involved whether participants judged a news story as fake news dependent upon whether the article was presented (1) as it was published, (2) with source, author, and like data removed, (3) with presentation/formatting minimized, and (4) with source, author, and like data removed and also with presentation/formatting minimized. Any advertisements from the news sources were removed in all groups.

Four studies were conducted over the course of a year and a half. The first study was directly replicated three additional times. Each study was based on the news articles listed below in the **Articles** section.
